# Automated_Data_Crunching
This is a stand-alone Ubunto utility that automates statistical modeling of raw data and database storing of analysis outcomes. It features R analytic rutines that are auto-triggered when raw data are available, as well as email reports of analysis success/failure. It is integrated as Module 3 in my composite project: Data Analysis Pipeline
